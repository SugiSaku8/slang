 # S-Lang Specification

## Overview
S-Lang is a high-performance, safe programming language that combines the low-level control of C with the safety features of Rust. It features a unique priority ownership system, advanced type system, and comprehensive tooling support.

## Core Features

### 1. Language Design
- C-like low-level control with Rust-like safety
- Priority ownership system
- Advanced type system
- Safe memory management
- Modern syntax
- Mathematical computation support
- Module system
- File extension system

### 2. Priority Ownership System
The priority ownership system is a unique feature that manages runtime priorities for variables, functions, and memory.

#### Types of Priority Ownership
1. **Log Priority Ownership**
   - Log levels: log, warn, alert, error, debug, info
   - Two-dimensional structure
   - Default priorities for each level

2. **Function Priority Ownership**
   - One-dimensional structure
   - Dynamic priority adjustment
   - Priority inheritance

3. **Memory Priority Ownership**
   - 1-4 dimensional structure
   - Dynamic priority management
   - Priority competition handling

### 3. Type System

#### Basic Types
- `int`: 64-bit integer
- `float`: 64-bit floating point
- `bool`: Boolean
- `char`: UTF-8 character
- `string`: UTF-8 string
- `void`: Empty type

#### Composite Types
- Arrays: `[T; N]`
- Tuples: `(T1, T2, ...)`
- Structs: `struct`
- Enums: `enum`

#### Mathematical Types
- Vectors: `Vector<N, T>`
- Matrices: `Matrix<M, N, T>`
- Tensors: `Tensor<Dims, T>`

### 9. Syntax Features

#### Basic Syntax
```slang
// Variable declaration
let x: int = 42;

// Function definition
fn add(a: int, b: int) -> int {
    return a + b;
}

// Priority ownership
Var:type:priority:[1, 2];

// Pattern matching
match value {
    Some(x) => log!("Found: {}", x),
    None => log!("Not found"),
}
```

#### Priority Ownership Syntax
```slang
// Log priority
log!("Message");  // Priority: [Log, 0]
info!("Message"); // Priority: [Log, 1]
debug!("Message"); // Priority: [Log, 2]

// Function priority
Function:type:priority:1;

// Memory priority
Var:type:priority:[1, 2];
```
